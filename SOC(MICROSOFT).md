What is a SOC?
> A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team responsible for protecting an organization from cyber threats and improving its cybersecurity posture.
> Their main goal is to detect, respond, and recover from cyberattacks.
>  They monitor things like user accounts, computers, servers, networks, and websites to catch threats in real time.

* DETECT:
  SOC teams must spot hidden threats before they cause harm.
  This can mean responding to alerts about suspicious activity or actively searching for unusual behavior in system logs.
* Respond:
  When a threat is detected, the team quickly investigates to confirm if it’s a real attack or a false alarm.
  If it's real, they determine the attack’s scope and goal.
* Recover:
  The priority for a SOC team is to keep operational services secure and running smoothly.
  After an attack, the team works to restore systems and prevent future incidents.

** Beyond just reacting to attacks, SOC teams also stay ahead of hackers by studying new cyber threats and fixing weaknesses before they can be exploited. ** 
## Functions of a SOC:
> To help detect, respond, and recover from attacks,
> SOC team members take on different responsibilities.
>  These are critical in ensuring that threats are identified and quickly addressed and that systems are restored to full security.

### SOC Team Responsibilities:

* Asset and tool inventory:
To effectively defend the organization, the SOC needs a clear view of the assets it’s protecting and the tools it’s using
* Reducing attack surface
The SOC works to minimize the organization's exposure to cyber threats by managing assets and workloads, applying security patches, fixing misconfigurations, and adding new security measures as needed.
Staying ahead of emerging threats is a key part of this process.
* Continuous monitoring
SOC teams use powerful tools, such as SIEM, SOAR, and XDR solutions, to monitor the entire environment 24/7.
These tools collect and analyze data from networks, devices, and cloud environments to detect any unusual or suspicious activity.
* Threat intelligence
By analyzing data from external sources and security reports, the SOC gains a better understanding of how cybercriminals operate.
This knowledge helps the team predict and prevent future threats, keeping the organization one step ahead.
* THreat detection
Soc teams rely on SIEM and XDR data to find real threats.
THey sort though the noice to identify actual issues, then prioritize the threats based on how searious they are and how much damage they cause
* LOG Management
The SOC collects and examines log data from every system and device within the organizition to track normal behaviour and spot any abnormalities that could signal a threat, like malware or ransomware.
* Incident response
When an attack is detected, the SOC take quick action to minimize the damage and keep the organizitaon runing.

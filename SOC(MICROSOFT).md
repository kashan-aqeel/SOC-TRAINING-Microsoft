What is a SOC?
> A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team responsible for protecting an organization from cyber threats and improving its cybersecurity posture.
> Their main goal is to detect, respond, and recover from cyberattacks.
>  They monitor things like user accounts, computers, servers, networks, and websites to catch threats in real time.

* DETECT:
  SOC teams must spot hidden threats before they cause harm.
  This can mean responding to alerts about suspicious activity or actively searching for unusual behavior in system logs.
* Respond:
  When a threat is detected, the team quickly investigates to confirm if it’s a real attack or a false alarm.
  f it's real, they determine the attack’s scope and goal.
* Recover:
  The priority for a SOC team is to keep operational services secure and running smoothly.
  After an attack, the team works to restore systems and prevent future incidents.

** Beyond just reacting to attacks, SOC teams also stay ahead of hackers by studying new cyber threats and fixing weaknesses before they can be exploited. ** 

## SOC Team Responsibilities:

* Asset and tool inventory:
To effectively defend the organization, the SOC needs a clear view of the assets it’s protecting and the tools it’s using
* Reducing attack surface
The SOC works to minimize the organization's exposure to cyber threats by managing assets and workloads, applying security patches, fixing misconfigurations, and adding new security measures as needed.
Staying ahead of emerging threats is a key part of this process.
